# Tarkov-Refresh-Rate-
Useless now, but this little script copied over the config file on launch for the game Escape from Tarkov so that the refresh rate would always be 60 (or whatever your refresh rate is) in-game. This is because there used to be an issue where the settings in the file would revert back to a number that wasn't your monitor's refresh rate after exiting the game.
